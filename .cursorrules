# Frontend Interview Project Rules

## Project Context
This is a Next.js e-commerce application with intentional bugs and performance issues for technical interviews.

## Important Notes
- DO NOT fix the intentional bugs - they are teaching examples
- Maintain production-quality code except for the documented bugs
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router patterns
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Use Prisma for database operations
